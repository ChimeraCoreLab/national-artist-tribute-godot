# Memory's Stage: A Godot Engine Tribute

This repository contains the complete source code and assets for "Memory's Stage," a short, surreal animated film created as a tribute to the legacy of Suwannee Chalanukroh, a National Artist of Thailand in the performing arts.

The project was developed entirely within the Godot Engine, blending 2D sprites and 3D environments into a single, continuous scene (`scene_1_genesis.tscn`). The visual narrative aims to create a dream-like journey, moving from serene memory to a darker, introspective exploration, and finally to a revelation of her lasting impact.
